### What I learned

Hey , this was my first react app , learnt a lot of things otw , like useState() and props, learnt how to work with components . . . I initially thought of using tailwind along with this but apparently don't find myself to be really comfortable with it . . . apparently there are issues that still need to be addressed :-

 - when user click on equals to and evaluates the string , the DEL btn doesn't work(not that I have added any functionality)
 - the input value doesn't reset when a new operand is clicked after evaluating the string , leading to new unwanted string being created
 - since I was in strict mode , octal literals weren't allowed due to which large calculations can't be calculated. I didn't address these issues coz I was too tired at this point , not to mention that this was my first react app to begin with, didn't know how I could add all these functionalities so gave it a break ...
